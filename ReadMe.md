##Description
Kenny ClassIQ is something like my dream project. It is a chess engine with pure object oriented programming with close-to-real-world representation of the game inside the program using OOPS. Initially I thought of doing a similar thing in C++, but after trying to develop my other chess engine [Kenny](https://www.github.com/kenshinthbattosai/Kenny) in this route, I found out that it is a difficult task, and switched to using Java for the programming instead. To learn how to do it, I created a similar, many-times-lesser-in-complexity project [KenTacToe](https://www.github.com/kenshinthebattosai/KenTacToe).

Having completed it successfully, I've gained the confidence to proceed with Kenny ClassIQ, named so because it is more class-oriented than Kenny, and because I want it to be intelligent. *(A play with words landed me Kenny ClassIQ.)* Also, I used this name so that people searching for my other chess engine Kenny can also find this more advanced chess engine (okay, yes, I wanted to name my chess engine Kenny, so).
