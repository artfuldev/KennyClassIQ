##Description

Kenny ClassIQ *(read Kenny Classic)* is something like my dream project. It is a chess engine with pure object oriented programming with close-to-real-world representation of the game inside the program using OOPS. Initially I thought of doing a similar thing in C++, but after trying to develop my other chess engine [Kenny](https://www.github.com/kenshinthebattosai/Kenny) in this route, I found out that it is a difficult task, and switched to using Java for the programming instead. To learn how to do it, I created a similar, many-times-lesser-in-complexity project [KenTacToe](https://www.github.com/kenshinthebattosai/KenTacToe).

Having completed it successfully, I've gained the confidence to proceed with Kenny ClassIQ, named so because it is more class-oriented than Kenny, and because I want it to be intelligent. *(A play with words landed me Kenny ClassIQ.)* Also, I used this name so that people searching for my other chess engine Kenny can also find this more advanced chess engine (okay, yes, I wanted to name my chess engine Kenny, so).

##Features
(Words in italics represent class names)

* Unplayable.
* Better *Move* system *(Players make Moves in the Game)*.
* Automatic *MoveList* of *Game* updation.
* Better *printMainLine()* implementation.
* Better *FEN* implementation.
* Better-than-ever *Console* implementation, with reader, listener and executor threads.
* Other features yet to come! :D

##Goals

###Long Term
* To have a close-to-real-world representation of the game inside the program

###Short Term
* To finish defining only the necessary things for a game, ie, *Square, Piece*, etc, and atleast play random moves.
* To do move generation and legal move checking.
* To finish defining *Game*.
* To finish adding commentary to all uploaded files.
